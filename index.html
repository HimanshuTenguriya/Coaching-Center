        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences.The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some machines; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants.Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulate from repeated experiences.The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost" from that which cannot be retrieved.

            Human learning starts at birth (it might even start beforein terms of an embryo's need for both interaction with, and freedom within its environment within the womb.and continues until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions between people and their environment.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Parenting has always been a realization and reminiscence of the blissful days of our childhood. During our childhood, our parents made sure that we are more connected to the world and the people around us. While they led our little minds to explore and interact with the world, they gave us the wisdom to find the difference between the right and the wrong. They wanted us to learn from our mistakes and experiences. They gave us the freedom to build our own worlds which were much bigger and unique than today’s generation. Kids learn through experiences and not through words. They imitate what parents do. When their play is restricted, they tend to lean towards the electronic gadgets and start creating their own world of experience around them. Our kids need ‘smarter’ parents, not smartphones. At TGS, we aim to create a bigger world for your kids where they can play and learn to excel in their life and we firmly stand by our tagline “Play, Learn and Grow Together”..</p>
